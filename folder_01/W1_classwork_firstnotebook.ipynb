    "- The bCourses site. This will be your home base where you will find the syllabus, important links, announcements, a discussion page, and reading quizzes. There will be a Module for each week of the semester where you can find the pre-class, during-class, and after-class work.\n",

So to avoid that we will run our Jupyter notebooks with a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) environment. However, you may in the future wish to install python on your own computer. When that day comes, go to [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) and follow the install instructions for your operating system. But for now that won't be neccessary. \n"
