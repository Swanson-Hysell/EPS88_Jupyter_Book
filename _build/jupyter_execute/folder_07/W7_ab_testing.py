# 7.1 A/B Testing


## Additional Assigned Reading

Data 8 textbook "Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science" By Ani Adhikari and John DeNero[Chapter 11 Testing Hypotheses](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/11/Testing_Hypotheses.html) and  [Chapter 12 Comparing Two Samples](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/12/Comparing_Two_Samples.html). This should overlap with your assigned reading for Data 8.

## A/B Testing 

> In modern data analytics, deciding whether two numerical samples come from the same underlying distribution is called A/B testing. The name refers to the labels of the two samples, A and B. 

> **The Hypotheses**

> We can try to answer this question by a test of hypotheses. The chance model that we will test says that there is no underlying difference in the popuations; the distributions in the samples are different just due to chance.

> Formally, this is the null hypothesis. We are going to have to figure out how to simulate a useful statistic under this hypothesis. But as a start, let's just state the two natural hypotheses.

*from [Chapter 12 Comparing Two Samples](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/12/1/AB_Testing.html)*

In the example in Data 8, students are asked to consider the birth weight of babies when the mother was a smoker and when the mother was a nonsmoker. The two hypotheses and the test statistic were:

> **Null hypothesis**: In the population, the distribution of birth weights of babies is the same for mothers who don't smoke as for mothers who do. The difference in the sample is due to chance.

> **Alternative hypothesis**: In the population, the babies of the mothers who smoke have a lower birth weight, on average, than the babies of the non-smokers.

> **Test Statistic**

> The alternative hypothesis compares the average birth weights of the two groups and says that the average for the mothers who smoke is smaller. Therefore it is reasonable for us to use the difference between the two group means as our statistic.

> We will do the subtraction in the order "average weight of the smoking group  âˆ’ average weight of the non-smoking group". Small values (that is, large negative values) of this statistic will favor the alternative hypothesis.

We'll use an A/B testing method to explore the geochemistry of ingeous rocks.
