Chapter 6: Probability Distributions and Random Earth Processes
=======================

This week we will be considering physical processes which can be modeled as random events controlled by some probability distribution.

In this reading assignment you will build background knowledge about random sampling and Poisson processes. A Poisson probability distribution expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time. The events occur independently and with a constant average rate. The occurrence of an event does not depend on the time since the last event.
